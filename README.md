**Data**  
Trip histories from [Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) were retrieved and processed using the notebook `data_processing`. After cleaning, there were more than the allowed 15 million rows for Tableau Public, so rows were randomly removed to reach that maximum. Note that the resulting `.csv` file is around 3gb.

**Story**
