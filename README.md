# Citi Bike Analysis with Tableau
Using Tableau Public, 2019 Citi Bike data was visualized in storybook form.

**Data**  
Trip histories were taken from [Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and processed using the notebook `data_processing`. After cleaning, there were more than the allowed 15 million rows for Tableau Public, so rows were randomly removed to reach that maximum. Note that the resulting `.csv` file is around 3gb.

**Story**
